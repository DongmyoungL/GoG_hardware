CAD files for Gripper-on-Gripper (GoG) design. This gripper is specifically designed to facilitate bimanual cloth manipulation, including actions like folding and flattening, using a only a single robot arm. The gripper configuration comprises two distinct features: a Width Control Gripper (WCG) and two Variable Friction Gripper (VFG). 
- WCG functions as a large-scale gripper mechanism responsible for regulating the width of the two VFGS, with a range of up to 500mm. 
- Two VFGs consists of a variable friction module that enables to actuate two grasping modes passively
  - Firm grasp
  - Sliding grasp
